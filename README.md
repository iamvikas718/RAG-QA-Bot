Project Summary: RAG Business QA Bot with Gemini

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for business question-answering, using Google Gemini for document retrieval and OpenAI for answer generation. The solution provides accurate, context-aware responses by combining semantic search with AI-powered text generation.

Key Features:
- Uses Gemini's embedding and retrieval capabilities 
- Maintains OpenAI for high-quality answer generation (can optionally use Gemini)
- Runs entirely in Google Colab for easy setup
- Processes business documents into searchable knowledge
- Provides natural language answers grounded in company documentation

Technical Implementation:
1. Document Processing: Converts business content into embeddings using Gemini
2. Semantic Search: Matches user questions to relevant document sections
3. Answer Generation: OpenAI synthesizes human-like responses from retrieved content

Advantages:
- Eliminates need for separate vector database
- Uses Google's latest AI models for retrieval
- Simplified architecture with maintained accuracy
- Cost-effective using free-tier APIs

Business Applications:
- Customer support automation
- Internal knowledge management
- Employee training and onboarding
- Standardized responses to common queries

This solution demonstrates how modern AI services can be combined to create practical business tools with minimal infrastructure requirements. The system can be customized for specific industries or document types.

# RAG-QA-Bot
**Project Summary: RAG Business QA Bot with Gemini**

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for business question-answering, leveraging **Google Gemini** for document retrieval and **OpenAI** for answer generation. The solution provides accurate, context-aware responses by combining semantic search with AI-powered text generation.

**Key Features:**
- Uses **Gemini's embedding and retrieval capabilities** 
- Maintains **OpenAI for high-quality answer generation** (can optionally use Gemini)
- Runs entirely in **Google Colab** for easy setup
- Processes business documents (FAQs, manuals, policies) into searchable knowledge
- Provides **natural language answers** grounded in company documentation

**Technical Implementation:**
1. **Document Processing:** Converts business content into embeddings using Gemini
2. **Semantic Search:** Matches user questions to relevant document sections
3. **Answer Generation:** OpenAI synthesizes human-like responses from retrieved content

**Advantages of Gemini Integration:**
- Eliminates need for separate vector database
- Leverages Google's latest AI models for retrieval
- Simplifies architecture while maintaining accuracy
- Cost-effective (uses free-tier APIs)

**Business Applications:**
- 24/7 customer support automation
- Internal knowledge management
- Employee training and onboarding
- Standardized responses to common queries

**Setup Requirements:**
- Google Colab environment
- Gemini API key (free tier available)
- OpenAI API key (optional if using Gemini for generation)

This solution demonstrates how modern AI services can be combined to create practical business tools with minimal infrastructure requirements. The system can be further customized for specific industries or document types.
